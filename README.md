# Week 2

## Ideation
The concept aims to portray the intricate water infrastructure of New York City, showing its 19 reservoirs and water supply system.
During a site research on the NYC water supply system, I found that the development process of water transportation has historically been challenging for NYC due to the city's topography and the need to transport water over long distances.
The NYC water supply system design highlights engineering excellence. One of the most remarkable features of the system is its utilization of gravity-driven aqueducts. The Croton Aqueduct, for example, relied solely on gravity to transport water from the Croton River to Manhattan, covering a distance of over 41 miles. This design minimized the need for mechanical pumping, reducing energy consumption. Interconnected reservoirs strategically located throughout the region enable adequate storage, regulation, and water distribution, ensuring a reliable supply for millions of residents.

## Design & Wireframes
I began delving deeper into the NYC water supply's reservoirs and discovered that the system consists of 19 reservoirs and three controlled lakes, spanning a vast 2,000-square-mile watershed.
I collected data for each reservoir, including its distance from NYC and its capacity, and I plan to create a map visualizing this data. Each reservoir will be represented by a clickable icon of a water vortex.

## Process
The webpage is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase circles representing reservoirs. Each circle is clickable and triggers a modal popup displaying an image of the respective reservoir and its description. The images are preloaded for better performance. The circles also have random change animations applied to them. The modal popup can be closed by clicking the 'x' button or by clicking outside the popup. 
The graphic drew inspiration from water ripple patterns. To maintain the grid layout of the page, I kept the size of the ripples consistent. I also want to experiment with mapping each reservoir's data to changes in radiation size and vortex speed and weave patterns for further exploration.
